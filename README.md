# Block Cypher Encryption From Scratch

This Project Contains The Following Symmetric Block Cyphers From Scratch In The Following Variants:

# DES
-Single DES\n
-Triple DES

# AES
-AES128
-AES192
-AES256

# Modes Of Encryption
(Currently Only In AES)
-ECB (Electronic Code Book)
-CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
-OFB (Output Feedback Mode)

Note:
For this implementation, speed was not a concern as it is an educational deep dive into block cyphers.
Every single function has been written by hand, showcasing all the operations that take place clearly.

Stats:
5000 characters Read+Encryption+Decryption+Write= 2.5 Seconds (OFB Mode)
