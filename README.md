# Block Cypher Encryption From Scratch

This Project Contains The Following Symmetric Block Cyphers From Scratch In The Following Variants:

# DES
-Single DES</br>
-Triple DES

# AES
-AES128
-AES192
-AES256

# Modes Of Encryption
(Currently Only In AES)</br>
-ECB (Electronic Code Book)</br>
-CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)</br>
-OFB (Output Feedback Mode)</br>

Note:</br>
For this implementation, speed was not a concern as it is an educational deep dive into block cyphers.</br>
Every single function has been written by hand, showcasing all the operations that take place clearly.</br>

Stats:</br>
5000 characters Read+Encryption+Decryption+Write= 2.5 Seconds (OFB Mode)
